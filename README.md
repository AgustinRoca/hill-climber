# hill-climber

Sample code for Computational Thinking course hands-on project (2023 fall semester). The code creates a server-client
game where the server generates a random mountain and the client tries to find its summit using a predefined algorithm.
Also a simple dashboard is provided to visualize the game.

## Disclaimer

This code was made as a proof of concept for a hands-on project in a course. It is not meant to be a full-fledged game.
The code is not optimized for performance, and it is not guaranteed to be bug-free.

## MacOS

MacOS has issues with `matplotlib` and `tkinter` right now. If you want to see the game board, you can run the game on a
different OS, or try to run it in a notebook.
